**Web3 Student Lab** is an open-source educational platform that helps students learn blockchain, smart contracts, open-source collaboration, and hackathon project development in one place.

The platform provides **interactive tools, coding environments, and guided learning paths** designed for beginners and university students.

## � Frequently Asked Questions

- New contributors with environment issues can start here: [docs/FAQ.md](docs/FAQ.md)

## �🚀 Core Modules

1. **Blockchain Learning Simulator**: Visually learn how blockchains work (create transactions, mine blocks, view hashes, and see how blocks connect).
2. **Smart Contract Playground**: Write, run, and test smart contracts directly in your browser. Focuses on Soroban contracts written in Rust.
3. **Web3 Learning Roadmap**: A guided path spanning programming fundamentals, cryptography, blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and full Web3 applications.
4. **Hackathon Project Idea Generator**: Overcome coder's block by generating ideas based on technology and sector preferences.
5. **Open Source Contribution Trainer**: Get hands-on with Git, simulated GitHub issues, and PR exercises to confidently contribute to open source.

## 🐳 Getting Started with Docker

The easiest way to set up the local development environment (backend and database) is using Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Launching the Environment
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
3. The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
4. The PostgreSQL database will be accessible at `localhost:5432`.

### Useful Commands
- **Stop the environment**: `docker compose down`
- **View logs**: `docker compose logs -f`
- **Restart a specific service**: `docker compose restart backend`
